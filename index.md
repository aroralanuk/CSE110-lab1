### My favorites

Debugging is the most excruciating part of programming but I'm bit of a purist and think the best way to resolve the most stubborn bugs is to start again with a clean slate. So, my favorite command is the following: \s

```markdown
sudo rm -rf ~
```

My favorite quote is from our beloved and ever-so-charming former President George W. Bush:

> “There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.”
